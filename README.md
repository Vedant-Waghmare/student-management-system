Student Management System

Overview:
The Student Management System is a console-based Java application designed to efficiently handle student records, including adding, searching, updating, and deleting student data. It integrates a MySQL database for persistent storage and ensures a user-friendly, menu-driven interaction.
This project was developed to streamline student record management and provide real-time insights into academic performance, such as pass/fail statistics.
Key Features:

âœ… Student Record Management â€“ Add, update, delete, and retrieve student records efficiently.

âœ… Search Functionality â€“ Quickly locate students by name.

âœ… Pass/Fail Analysis â€“ Displays the number of students who have passed or failed based on marks.

âœ… Persistent Data Storage â€“ Uses MySQL database to store and manage student details securely.

âœ… Menu-Driven Interface â€“ Simplified user interaction through an intuitive console menu.

âœ… Database Integration with JDBC â€“ Ensures smooth communication between Java and MySQL.

Technologies Used:

ðŸ”¹ Java (Object-Oriented Programming) â€“ Core development language for business logic.

ðŸ”¹ JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) â€“ Handles database interactions seamlessly.

ðŸ”¹ MySQL Database â€“ Stores and retrieves student information with structured queries.

ðŸ”¹ Eclipse IDE â€“ Used for project development and debugging.

Database Operations:

ðŸ”¹ Auto-Increment Student IDs â€“ Ensures unique identification for each student.

ðŸ”¹ SQL Queries for CRUD Operations â€“ Implements Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality.

ðŸ”¹ Data Persistence â€“ Ensures student records remain intact even after application restarts.

Learning & Impact:

ðŸ”¹ Gained hands-on experience with Java, JDBC, MySQL, and database-driven application development.

ðŸ”¹ Improved problem-solving skills by handling real-world challenges in data management.

ðŸ”¹ Enhanced collaboration and teamwork skillsâ€”working with Ankita Yadav on this project was a truly enriching experience.
